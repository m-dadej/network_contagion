# to do:

- banks targeting profits instead of risk aversion - greedy shareholders
- $\lambda$ the capital req buffor is heterogenous
- $(1/1 - \xi * \delta)$, the cost of funding can be endogenous somehow
- why not faia model matching
- justify matching objective
- remove no short selling constraint
- index in A^ib
- when checking the system collaps calculate risk weighted default albo capital weighted
