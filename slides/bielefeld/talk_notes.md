1. Banks balance sheet

- sum(l_i,j) will be denoted as l_i for simplicity

2. financial network representation

- i will call it a loan to make it easier

- differentiating between l_i,j and b_i,j is a redundant coding

3.objective of banks

- Constant relative risk aversion is useful as it makes agents risk averse and the level of risk aversion is the same no matter the size of the agent

4. objective of banks - expected utility

- we take second order approximation in neighbourhood of expected profit

- The first term is equal to the one below, the second term is zero by the law of iterated expectations and the third one is variance

- This gives us the objective of the agent. In which banks have to decide on a trade off between a amount of profit it can receive and the variance. We can think of it as similar to mean variance optimization 

5. objective of banks- profit variance

We want to have some approximation of the profit variance.

First we use a simple properity of variance of sum of random variables

- we assume that the return on external assets is uncorrelated with cost of borrowing and set it to zero.

6. regulatory requirements

Banks need to follow the equity requirements set by the regulator that sets a threshold of equity over risk weighted assets.

the limit is gamma plus tau. The gamma is considered to be an actual limit whereas tau is a buffer that in practice banks want to maintain

7. Banks optimization

Banks decide on amount of cash, external assets and loans or borrowings on the interbanks market. Also, these variables have to be positive.


8. Interbank market

The banks decide their total amount of interbank asset or liabilites. 
But of course the supply and demand on the interbank market need to be equal.

And so we say that the market is in equilibrium when the total amount of loans decided by banks are equal to the declared borrowings


9. tatonment process

if the aggregated amount of borrowings is higher than the loans, then the interest rate is too low and we need to raise it

10. Matching funds

up until now we knew the equilibrium interest rates and the total amount of loans and borrowings

Now we need to exactly match the funds or where exactly the loans go

We try to match so that more risk averse banks will provide loans to less risky banks, as measured by the small k which is capital ratio

This is subject to several constraints 

The diagonals of the matrix needs to be 0

11. exogenous shock

the
